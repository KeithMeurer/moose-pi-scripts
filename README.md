# moose-pi-scripts
Bash scripts to install, configure, and tweak anything and everything on Raspberry Pis.

<ul>
<li>The idea here will be to have a script to install and configure anything.</li>
<li>Each script should either be standalone or accept parameters when it needs them, no editing of scripts needed.</li>
<li>Each script should be self documenting based on comments at the top of the script.</li>
</ul>

As this grows, this script list will be updated with what's available.

Enjoy!
