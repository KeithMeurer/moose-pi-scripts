# moose-pi-scripts
Bash scripts to install, configure, and tweak anything and everything on Raspberry Pis.

Come to think of it, some will also work on Debian/Ubuntu flavors of Linux as well.

The idea here will be to have a script to install and configure anything.
<ul>
<li>Each script should either be standalone or accept parameters when it needs them, no editing of scripts needed.</li>
<li>Each script should be self documenting based on comments at the top of the script.</li>
</ul>

Scripts:
<ul>
<li>mariadb.setup.sh - setup of mariadb including network access and one additional user.</li>

</ul>

As this grows, this script list will be updated with what's available.

Enjoy!
